    /** InstanceBatch forms part of the new Instancing system
        This is an abstract class that must be derived to implement different instancing techniques
        (@see InstanceManager::InstancingTechnique)
        OGRE wasn't truly thought for instancing. OGRE assumes that either:
            a. One MovableObject -> No Renderable
            b. One MovableObject -> One Renderable
            c. One MovableObject -> Many Renderable.
        However, instances work on reverse: Many MovableObject have the same Renderable.
        <b>Instancing is already difficult to cull by a CPU</b>, but the main drawback from this assumption
        is that it makes it even harder to take advantage from OGRE's culling capabilities
        (i.e. @see OctreeSceneManager)
    @par
        To workaround this problem, InstanceBatch updates on almost every frame,
        growing the bounding box to fit all instances that are not being culled individually.
        This helps by avoiding a huge bbox that may cover the whole scene, which decreases shadow
        quality considerably (as it is seen as large shadow receiver)
        Furthermore, if no individual instance is visible, the InstanceBatch switches it's visibility
        (@see MovableObject::setVisible) to avoid sending this Renderable to the GPU. This happens because
        even when no individual instance is visible, their merged bounding box may cause OGRE to think
        the batch is visible (i.e. the camera is looking between object A & B, but A & B aren't visible)
    @par
        <b>As it happens with instancing in general, all instanced entities from the same batch will share
        the same textures and materials</b>
    @par
        Each InstanceBatch preallocates a fixed amount of mInstancesPerBatch instances once it's been
        built (@see build, @see buildFrom).
        @see createInstancedEntity and @see removeInstancedEntity on how to retrieve those instances
        remove them from scene.
        Note that, on GPU side, removing an instance from scene doesn't save GPU cycles on what
        respects vertex shaders, but saves a little fillrate and pixel shaders; unless all instances
        are removed, which saves GPU.
        For more information, @see InstancedEntity
