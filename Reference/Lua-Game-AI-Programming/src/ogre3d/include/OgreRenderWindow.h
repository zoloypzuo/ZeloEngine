        @remarks
            This class handles a window into which the contents
            of a scene are rendered. There is a many-to-1 relationship
            between instances of this class an instance of RenderSystem
            which controls the rendering of the scene. There may be
            more than one window in the case of level editor tools etc.
            This class is abstract since there may be
            different implementations for different windowing systems.
        @remarks
            Instances are created and communicated with by the render system
            although client programs can get a reference to it from
            the render system if required for resizing or moving.
            Note that you can have multiple viewpoints
            in the window for effects like rear-view mirrors and
            picture-in-picture views (see Viewport and Camera).
