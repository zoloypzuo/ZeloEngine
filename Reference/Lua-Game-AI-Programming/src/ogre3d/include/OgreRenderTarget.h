                (started using Root::startRendering),
                the user of the library is responsible for asking each render
                target to refresh. This is the method used to do this. It automatically
                re-renders the contents of the target using whatever cameras have been
                pointed at it (using Camera::setRenderTarget).
            @par
                This allows OGRE to be used in multi-windowed utilities
                and for contents to be refreshed only when required, rather than
                constantly as with the automatic rendering loop.
			@param swapBuffers For targets that support double-buffering, if set 
				to true, the target will immediately
				swap it's buffers after update. Otherwise, the buffers are
				not swapped, and you have to call swapBuffers yourself sometime
				later. You might want to do this on some rendersystems which 
				pause for queued rendering commands to complete before accepting
				swap buffers calls - so you could do other CPU tasks whilst the 
				queued commands complete. Or, you might do this if you want custom
				control over your windows, such as for externally created windows.

                a viewport to the render target, rendering from the supplied camera. The
