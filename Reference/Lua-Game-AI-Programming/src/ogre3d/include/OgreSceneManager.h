    /** Manages the organisation and rendering of a 'scene' i.e. a collection 
		of objects and potentially world geometry.
    @remarks
		This class defines the interface and the basic behaviour of a 
		'Scene Manager'. A SceneManager organises the culling and rendering of
		the scene, in conjunction with the RenderQueue. This class is designed 
		to be extended through subclassing in order to provide more specialised
		scene organisation structures for particular needs. The default 
		SceneManager culls based on a hierarchy of node bounding boxes, other
		implementations can use an octree (@see OctreeSceneManager), a BSP
		tree (@see BspSceneManager), and many other options. New SceneManager
		implementations can be added at runtime by plugins, see 
		SceneManagerEnumerator for the interfaces for adding new SceneManager
		types.
	@par
		There is a distinction between 'objects' (which subclass MovableObject, 
		and are movable, discrete objects in the world), and 'world geometry',
		which is large, generally static geometry. World geometry tends to 
		influence the SceneManager organisational structure (e.g. lots of indoor
		static geometry might result in a spatial tree structure) and as such
		world geometry is generally tied to a given SceneManager implementation,
		whilst MovableObject instances can be used with any SceneManager.
		Subclasses are free to define world geometry however they please.
	@par
		Multiple SceneManager instances can exist at one time, each one with 
		a distinct scene. Which SceneManager is used to render a scene is
		dependent on the Camera, which will always call back the SceneManager
		which created it to render the scene.

			to create any objects you need separately and fully prepare them
			before doing all your scene graph work in one go, thus keeping this
			lock for the shortest time possible.

			A single global lock is used rather than a per-node lock since 
			it keeps the number of locks required during rendering down to a 
			minimum. Obtaining a lock, even if there is no contention, is not free
			so for performance it is good to do it as little as possible. 
			Since modifying the scene in a separate thread is a fairly

                A sky dome is actually formed by 5 sides of a cube, but with
                texture coordinates generated such that the surface appears
                curved like a dome. Sky domes are appropriate where you need a
                realistic looking sky where the scene is not going to be
                'fogged', and there is always a 'floor' of some sort to prevent
                the viewer looking below the horizon (the distortion effect below
                the horizon can be pretty horrible, and there is never anyhting
                directly below the viewer). If you need a complete wrap-around
                background, use the setSkyBox method instead. You can actually
                combine a sky box and a sky dome if you want, to give a positional
                backdrop with an overlayed curved cloud layer.
            @par
                Sky domes work well with 2D repeating textures like clouds. You
                can change the apparent 'curvature' of the sky depending on how
                your scene is viewed - lower curvatures are better for 'open'
                scenes like landscapes, whilst higher curvatures are better for

                This is the safest rendering method since all other objects
                will always appear in front of the sky. However this is not
                the most efficient way if most of the sky is often occluded
                by other objects. If this is the case, you can set this

            you have to call methods on Node and Animation in a particular order (namely

            help track the current time position of animations, the AnimationState object
            is provided.
            So if you don't want to control animation application manually, call this method,
            update the returned object as you like every frame and let SceneManager apply 
            the animation state for you.
        @par
            Remember, AnimationState objects are disabled by default at creation time. 
            Turn them on when you want them using their setEnabled method.
        @par

            modified using Node::setInitialState the Node assumes it's initial state is at the
            origin. If you want the base state of the SceneNode to be elsewhere, make your changes
            to the node using the standard transform methods, then call setInitialState to 
            'bake' this reference position into the node.

        @remarks   
            There are multiple ways to generate shadows in a scene, and each has 
            strengths and weaknesses. 
            <ul><li>Stencil-based approaches can be used to 
            draw very long, extreme shadows without loss of precision and the 'additive'
            version can correctly show the shadowing of complex effects like bump mapping
            because they physically exclude the light from those areas. However, the edges
            are very sharp and stencils cannot handle transparency, and they involve a 
            fair amount of CPU work in order to calculate the shadow volumes, especially
            when animated objects are involved.</li>
            <li>Texture-based approaches are good for handling transparency (they can, for
            example, correctly shadow a mesh which uses alpha to represent holes), and they
            require little CPU overhead, and can happily shadow geometry which is deformed
            by a vertex program, unlike stencil shadows. However, they have a fixed precision 
            which can introduce 'jaggies' at long range and have fillrate issues of their own.</li>
            </ul>
        @par
            We support 2 kinds of stencil shadows, and 2 kinds of texture-based shadows, and one
            simple decal approach. The 2 stencil approaches differ in the amount of multipass work 
            that is required - the modulative approach simply 'darkens' areas in shadow after the 
            main render, which is the least expensive, whilst the additive approach has to perform 
            a render per light and adds the cumulative effect, which is more expensive but more 
            accurate. The texture based shadows both work in roughly the same way, the only difference is
            that the shadowmap approach is slightly more accurate, but requires a more recent
            graphics card.
        @par
            Note that because mixing many shadow techniques can cause problems, only one technique
            is supported at once. Also, you should call this method at the start of the

		@remarks
			Stencil shadow coherency is very reliant on the shadow volume
			not being clipped by the far plane. If this clipping happens, you
			get a kind of 'negative' shadow effect. The best way to achieve
			coherency is to move the far plane of the camera out to infinity,
			thus preventing the far plane from clipping the shadow volumes.
			When combined with vertex program extrusion of the volume to 
			infinity, which	Ogre does when available, this results in very
			robust shadow volumes. For this reason, when you enable stencil 
			shadows, Ogre automatically changes your camera settings to 
			project to infinity if the card supports it. You can disable this
			behaviour if you like by calling this method; although you can 
			never enable infinite projection if the card does not support it.
		@par	
			If you disable infinite projection, or it is not available, 
			you need to be far more careful with your light attenuation /
			directional light extrusion distances to avoid clipping artefacts
			at the far plane.
		@note
			Recent cards will generally support infinite far plane projection.
			However, we have found some cases where they do not, especially
			on Direct3D. There is no standard capability we can check to 
			validate this, so we use some heuristics based on experience:
			<UL>
			<LI>OpenGL always seems to support it no matter what the card</LI>
			<LI>Direct3D on non-vertex program capable systems (including 
			vertex program capable cards on Direct3D7) does not
			support it</LI>
			<LI>Direct3D on GeForce3 and GeForce4 Ti does not seem to support
			infinite projection<LI>
			</UL>
			Therefore in the RenderSystem implementation, we may veto the use
			of an infinite far plane based on these heuristics.

			translation in the view matrix, it only includes the rotation, and

			mode in Ogre (OGRE_DOUBLE_PRECISION), since even though this will 
			alleviate the rendering precision, the source camera and object positions will still 
			suffer from precision issues leading to jerky movement.
