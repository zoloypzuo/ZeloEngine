Acknowledgements

The libtiff software was written by Sam Leffler while working for Silicon Graphics.
The LZW algorithm is derived from the compress program (the proper attribution is included in the source code). The Group 3 fax stuff originated as code from Jef Poskanzer, but has since been rewritten several times. The latest version uses an algorithm from Frank Cringle -- consult libtiff/mkg3states.c and libtiff/tif_fax3.h for further information. The JPEG support was written by Tom Lane and is dependent on the excellent work of Tom Lane and the Independent JPEG Group (IJG) who distribute their work under friendly licensing similar to this software. Many other people have by now helped with bug fixes and code; a few of the more persistent contributors have been:

Warning

It appears that Unisys is actively pursuing copyright control on the LZW compression algorithm. In particular, users of the LZW compression within the TIFF framework. For this reason the TIFF 6.0 spec states that LZW compression is not recommended. It is unclear at this time what compression algorithm will be used in place of it. I have no idea what this means to you or to this library. I make no warranty or guarantees with regard to the LZW support in this library.
