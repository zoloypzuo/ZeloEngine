Description
Representation of 2D vectors and points.

This structure is used in some places to represent 2D positions and vectors (e.g. texture coordinates in a Mesh or texture offsets in Material). In the majority of other cases a Vector3 is used.

Static Properties
down	Shorthand for writing Vector2(0, -1).
left	Shorthand for writing Vector2(-1, 0).
negativeInfinity	Shorthand for writing Vector2(float.NegativeInfinity, float.NegativeInfinity).
one	Shorthand for writing Vector2(1, 1).
positiveInfinity	Shorthand for writing Vector2(float.PositiveInfinity, float.PositiveInfinity).
right	Shorthand for writing Vector2(1, 0).
up	Shorthand for writing Vector2(0, 1).
zero	Shorthand for writing Vector2(0, 0).
Properties
magnitude	Returns the length of this vector (Read Only).
normalized	Returns this vector with a magnitude of 1 (Read Only).
sqrMagnitude	Returns the squared length of this vector (Read Only).
this[int]	Access the x or y component using [0] or [1] respectively.
x	X component of the vector.
y	Y component of the vector.
Constructors
Vector2	Constructs a new vector with given x, y components.
Public Methods
Equals	Returns true if the given vector is exactly equal to this vector.
Normalize	Makes this vector have a magnitude of 1.
Set	Set x and y components of an existing Vector2.
ToString	Returns a nicely formatted string for this vector.
Static Methods
Angle	Returns the unsigned angle in degrees between from and to.
ClampMagnitude	Returns a copy of vector with its magnitude clamped to maxLength.
Distance	Returns the distance between a and b.
Dot	Dot Product of two vectors.
Lerp	Linearly interpolates between vectors a and b by t.
LerpUnclamped	Linearly interpolates between vectors a and b by t.
Max	Returns a vector that is made from the largest components of two vectors.
Min	Returns a vector that is made from the smallest components of two vectors.
MoveTowards	Moves a point current towards target.
Perpendicular	Returns the 2D vector perpendicular to this 2D vector. The result is always rotated 90-degrees in a counter-clockwise direction for a 2D coordinate system where the positive Y axis goes up.
Reflect	Reflects a vector off the vector defined by a normal.
Scale	Multiplies two vectors component-wise.
SignedAngle	Returns the signed angle in degrees between from and to.
SmoothDamp	Gradually changes a vector towards a desired goal over time.
Operators
operator -	Subtracts one vector from another.
operator *	Multiplies a vector by a number.
operator /	Divides a vector by a number.
operator +	Adds two vectors.
operator ==	Returns true if two vectors are approximately equal.
Vector2	Converts a Vector3 to a Vector2.
Vector3	Converts a Vector2 to a Vector3.
