    This utility is a spatial database which stores objects each of
    which is associated with a 3d point (a location in a 3d space).
    The points serve as the "search key" for the associated object.
    It is intended to efficiently answer "sphere inclusion" queries,
    also known as range queries: basically questions like:

        Which objects are within a radius R of the location L?

    In this context, "efficiently" means significantly faster than the
    naive, brute force O(n) testing of all known points.  Additionally
    it is assumed that the objects move along unpredictable paths, so
    that extensive preprocessing (for example, constructing a Delaunay
    triangulation of the point set) may not be practical.

    The implementation is a "bin lattice": a 3d rectangular array of
    brick-shaped (rectangular parallelepipeds) regions of space.  Each
    region is represented by a pointer to a (possibly empty) doubly-
    linked list of objects.  All of these sub-bricks are the same
    size.  All bricks are aligned with the global coordinate axes.

    Terminology used here: the region of space associated with a bin
    is called a sub-brick.  The collection of all sub-bricks is called
    the super-brick.  The super-brick should be specified to surround
    the region of space in which (almost) all the key-points will
    exist.  If key-points move outside the super-brick everything will
    continue to work, but without the speed advantage provided by the
    spatial subdivision.  For more details about how to specify the
    super-brick's position, size and subdivisions see lqCreateDatabase
    below.

    Overview of usage: an application using this facility would first
    create a database with lqCreateDatabase.  For each client object
    the application wants to put in the database it creates a
    lqClientProxy and initializes it with lqInitClientProxy.  When a
    client object moves, the application calls lqUpdateForNewLocation.
    To perform a query lqMapOverAllObjectsInLocality is passed an
    application-supplied call-back function to be applied to all
    client objects in the locality.  See lqCallBackFunction below for
    more detail.  The lqFindNearestNeighborWithinRadius function can
    be used to find a single nearest neighbor using the database.

    Note that "locality query" is also known as neighborhood query,
    neighborhood search, near neighbor search, and range query.  For
    additional information on this and related topics see:
    http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/ips.html
