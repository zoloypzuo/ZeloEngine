    /** Class defining a single pass of a Technique (of a Material), i.e.
        a single rendering call.
        @remarks
        Rendering can be repeated with many passes for more complex effects.
        Each pass is either a fixed-function pass (meaning it does not use
        a vertex or fragment program) or a programmable pass (meaning it does
        use either a vertex and fragment program, or both).
        @par
        Programmable passes are complex to define, because they require custom
        programs and you have to set all constant inputs to the programs (like
        the position of lights, any base material colours you wish to use etc), but
        they do give you much total flexibility over the algorithms used to render your
        pass, and you can create some effects which are impossible with a fixed-function pass.
        On the other hand, you can define a fixed-function pass in very little time, and
        you can use a range of fixed-function effects like environment mapping very
        easily, plus your pass will be more likely to be compatible with older hardware.
        There are pros and cons to both, just remember that if you use a programmable
        pass to create some great effects, allow more time for definition and testing.

            The hashcode of a Pass is used to sort Passes for rendering, in order

            single unique set of states, but by ordering them, state changes can
            be minimised between passes. An implementation of this functor should
            order passes so that the elements that you want to keep constant are
            sorted next to each other.

            Fogging is an effect that is applied as polys are rendered. Sometimes, you want
            fog to be applied to an entire scene. Other times, you want it to be applied to a few

            both.
            @par

            rest of the scene by specifying FOG_NONE. Otherwise, set a pass-specific fog mode as
            defined in the enum FogMode.
            @param

            @remarks
            When polygons are coplanar, you can get problems with 'depth fighting' where
            the pixels from the two polys compete for the same screen pixel. This is particularly
            a problem for decals (polys attached to another surface to represent details such as
            bulletholes etc.).
            @par
            A way to combat this problem is to use a depth bias to adjust the depth buffer value
            used for the decal such that it is slightly higher than the true value, ensuring that
            the decal appears on top. There are two aspects to the biasing, a constant
            bias value and a slope-relative biasing value, which varies according to the
            maximum depth slope relative to the camera, ie:
            <pre>finalBias = maxSlope * slopeScaleBias + constantBias</pre>

        /** Sets whether or not this pass should iterate per light or number of
            lights which can affect the object being rendered.
            @remarks
            The default behaviour for a pass (when this option is 'false'), is
            for a pass to be rendered only once (or the number of times set in
            setPassIterationCount), with all the lights which could
            affect this object set at the same time (up to the maximum lights
            allowed in the render system, which is typically 8).
            @par
            Setting this option to 'true' changes this behaviour, such that
            instead of trying to issue render this pass once per object, it
            is run <b>per light</b>, or for a group of 'n' lights each time
            which can affect this object, the number of
            times set in setPassIterationCount (default is once). In
            this case, only light index 0 is ever used, and is a different light
            every time the pass is issued, up to the total number of lights
            which is affecting this object. This has 2 advantages:
            <ul><li>There is no limit on the number of lights which can be
            supported</li>
            <li>It's easier to write vertex / fragment programs for this because
            a single program can be used for any number of lights</li>
            </ul>
            However, this technique is more expensive, and typically you
            will want an additional ambient pass, because if no lights are
            affecting the object it will not be rendered at all, which will look
            odd even if ambient light is zero (imagine if there are lit objects
            behind it - the objects silhouette would not show up). Therefore,
            use this option with care, and you would be well advised to provide
            a less expensive fallback technique for use in the distance.
            @note
            The number of times this pass runs is still limited by the maximum
            number of lights allowed as set in setMaxSimultaneousLights, so
            you will never get more passes than this. Also, the iteration is
            started from the 'start light' as set in Pass::setStartLight, and
            the number of passes is the number of lights to iterate over divided
            by the number of lights per iteration (default 1, set by
            setLightCountPerIteration).
            @param enabled Whether this feature is enabled

            alternative vertex program which can be used to render the object
            as a shadow receiver. Do all the same vertex transforms, but generate
            <strong>2 sets</strong> of texture coordinates using the auto parameter
            ACT_TEXTURE_VIEWPROJ_MATRIX, which Ogre will bind to the parameter name /
            index you supply as the second parameter to this method. 2 texture
            sets are needed because Ogre needs to use 2 texture units for some
            shadow effects.
            @note
            This is only applicable to programmable passes.
            @par

            rendering if an explict vertex program alternative is not set.

            @remarks
            Texture shadows are applied by rendering the receiver. Modulative texture
            shadows are performed as a post-render darkening pass, and as such
            fragment programs are generally not required per-object. Additive
            texture shadows, however, are applied by accumulating light masked
            out using a texture shadow (black & white by default, unless you
            customise this using SceneManager::setCustomShadowCasterMaterial).
            OGRE can do this for you for most materials, but if you use a custom
            lighting program (e.g. per pixel lighting) then you'll need to provide
            a custom version for receiving shadows. You don't need to provide
            this for shadow casters if you don't use self-shadowing since they
            will never be shadow receivers too.
            @par
            The shadow texture is always bound to texture unit 0 when rendering
            texture shadow passes. Therefore your custom shadow receiver program
            may well just need to shift it's texture unit usage up by one unit,
            and take the shadow texture into account in its calculations.

            When using an additive lighting mode (SHADOWTYPE_STENCIL_ADDITIVE or
            SHADOWTYPE_TEXTURE_ADDITIVE), the scene is rendered in 3 discrete
            stages, ambient (or pre-lighting), per-light (once per light, with
            shadowing) and decal (or post-lighting). Usually OGRE figures out how
            to categorise your passes automatically, but there are some effects you
            cannot achieve without manually controlling the illumination. For example
            specular effects are muted by the typical sequence because all textures
            are saved until the IS_DECAL stage which mutes the specular effect.
            Instead, you could do texturing within the per-light stage if it's
            possible for your material and thus add the specular on after the
            decal texturing, and have no post-light rendering.
            @par
            If you assign an illumination stage to a pass you have to assign it
            to all passes in the technique otherwise it will be ignored. Also note
            that whilst you can have more than one pass in each group, they cannot
            alternate, ie all ambient passes will be before all per-light passes,
            which will also be before all decal passes. Within their categories
            the passes will retain their ordering though.
