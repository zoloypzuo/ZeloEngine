	/** An abstraction of a viewport, i.e. a rendering region on a render
        target.
        @remarks
            A viewport is the meeting of a camera and a rendering surface -
            the camera renders the scene from a viewpoint, and places its
            results into some subset of a rendering target, which may be the
            whole surface or just a part of the surface. Each viewport has a
            single camera as source and a single target as destination. A
            camera only has 1 viewport, but a render target may have several.
            A viewport also has a Z-order, i.e. if there is more than one
            viewport on a single render target and they overlap, one must
            obscure the other in some predetermined way.
