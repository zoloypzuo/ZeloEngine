				Be aware that the default method caches results within a frame to 
				prevent unnecessary recalculation, so if you override this you 
				should provide your own caching to maintain performance.

				If you use texture shadows, there is an additional restriction - 
				since the lights which should have shadow textures rendered for
				them are determined based on the entire frustum, and not per-object,
				it is important that the lights returned at the start of this 
				list (up to the number of shadow textures available) are the same 
				lights that were used to generate the shadow textures, 
				and they are in the same order (particularly for additive effects).
			@note
				This method will not be called for additive stencil shadows since the
				light list cannot be varied per object with this technique.
