	/** Defines the functionality of a 3D API
	@remarks
	The RenderSystem class provides a base interface
	which abstracts the general functionality of the 3D API
	e.g. Direct3D or OpenGL. Whilst a few of the general
	methods have implementations, most of this class is
	abstract, requiring a subclass based on a specific API
	to be constructed to provide the full functionality.
	Note there are 2 levels to the interface - one which
	will be used often by the caller of the Ogre library,
	and one which is at a lower level and will be used by the
	other classes provided by Ogre. These lower level
	methods are prefixed with '_' to differentiate them.
	The advanced user of the library may use these lower
	level methods to access the 3D API at a more fundamental
	level (dealing direct with render states and rendering
	primitives), but still benefiting from Ogre's abstraction
	of exactly which 3D API is in use.
