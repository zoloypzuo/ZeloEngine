	/** Implements the Light Space Perspective Shadow Mapping Algorithm.
	@remarks
	Implements the LiSPSM algorithm for an advanced shadow map generation. LiSPSM was
	developed by Michael Wimmer, Daniel Scherzer and Werner Purgathofer of the TU Wien.
	The algorithm was presented on the Eurographics Symposium on Rendering 2004.
	@note
	Shadow mapping was introduced by Williams in 1978. First a depth image is rendered
	from the light's view and compared in a second pass with depth values of the normal 
	camera view. In case the depth camera's depth value is greater than the depth seen
	by the light the fragment lies in the shadow.
	The concept has a major draw back named perspective aliasing. The shadow map distri-
	butes the samples uniformly meaning the position of the viewer is ignored. For the 
	viewer however the perspective projection affects near objects to be displayed 
	bigger than further away objects. The same thing happens with the shadow map texels:
	Near shadows appear very coarse and far away shadows are perfectly sampled.
	In 2002 Stamminger et al. presented an algorithm called Perspective Shadow Maps 
	(PSM). PSM battles the perspective aliasing by distributing 50% of the shadow map 
	texels for objects in the range of <near clipping plane> to <near clipping plane * 2>
	which inverts the problem: The shadows near the viewer are perfectly sampled, 
	however far away shadow may contain aliasing artefacts. A near clipping plane may be
	a problem. But this is not the only one. In the post-perspective space the light 
	sources are non-intuitively mapped: Directional lights may become point light and 
	point lights may become directional lights. Also light sinks (opposite of a light 
	source) may appear.	Another problem are shadow casters located behind the viewer. 
	In post-projective space objects behind the viewer are mapped in front of him with 
	a flipped up-vector.
	LiSPSM battles the light source problem of the post-projective space by rearranging
	the light space before transformation in such a way that no special cases appear. 
	This is done by converting point/spot lights into directional lights. The light 
	space is arranged in such a way that the light direction equals the inverse UNIT_Y.
	In this combination	the directional light will neither change its type nor its 
	direction. Furthermore all visible objects and shadow casters affecting the user's 
	visible area lie in front of the shadow camera: After building the intersection body
	that contains all these objects (body intersection building was introduced with PSM; 
	have a look at the description for the method "calculateB" for further info) a 
	frustum around the body's light space bounding box is created. A parameter (called 
	'n') automatically adjusts the shadow map sample distribution by specifying the 
	frustum's view point - near plane which affects the perspective warp. In case the 
	distance is small the perspecive warp will be strong. As a consequence near objects 
	will gain quality.
	However there are still problems. PSM as well as LiSPSM only devote to minimize
	perspective aliasing. Projection aliasing is still a problem, also 'swimming 
	artefacts' still occur. The LiSPSM quality distribution is very good but not the 
	best available: Some sources say logarithmic shadow mapping is the non plus ultra, 
	however others reject this thought. There is a research project on logarithmic shadow 
	maps. The web page url is http://gamma.cs.unc.edu/logsm/. However there is no techical 
	report available yet (Oct 23rd, 2006).
