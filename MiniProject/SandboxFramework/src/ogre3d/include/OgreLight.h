    /** Representation of a dynamic light source in the scene.
    @remarks
        Lights are added to the scene like any other object. They contain various
        parameters like type, position, attenuation (how light intensity fades with
        distance), colour etc.
    @par
        The defaults when a light is created is pure white diffuse light, with no
        attenuation (does not decrease with distance) and a range of 1000 world units.
    @par
        Lights are created by using the SceneManager::createLight method. They can subsequently be
        added to a SceneNode if required to allow them to move relative to a node in the scene. A light attached
        to a SceneNode is assumed to have a base position of (0,0,0) and a direction of (0,0,1) before modification
        by the SceneNode's own orientation. If not attached to a SceneNode,
        the light's position and direction is as set using setPosition and setDirection.
    @par
        Remember also that dynamic lights rely on modifying the colour of vertices based on the position of
        the light compared to an object's vertex normals. Dynamic lighting will only look good if the
        object being lit has a fair level of tessellation and the normals are properly set. This is particularly
        true for the spotlight which will only look right on highly tessellated models. In the future OGRE may be
        extended for certain scene types so an alternative to the standard dynamic lighting may be used, such
            as dynamic lightmaps.

            two is performed by the ACT_LIGHT_CUSTOM entry, if that is used.

        @remarks
            This method allows a Light to map in a custom GPU program parameter
            based on it's own data. This is represented by a GPU auto parameter
            of ACT_LIGHT_CUSTOM, and to allow there to be more than one of these per
            Light, the 'data' field on the auto parameter will identify
            which parameter is being updated and on which light. The implementation 
            of this method must identify the parameter being updated, and call a 'setConstant' 
            method on the passed in GpuProgramParameters object.
        @par
            You do not need to override this method if you're using the standard
            sets of data associated with the Renderable as provided by setCustomParameter
            and getCustomParameter. By default, the implementation will map from the
            value indexed by the 'constantEntry.data' parameter to a value previously
            set by setCustomParameter. But custom Renderables are free to override
            this if they want, in any case.
        @param paramIndex
            The index of the constant being updated
        @param constantEntry
            The auto constant entry from the program parameters
        @param params
            The parameters object which this method should call to 
            set the updated parameters.
