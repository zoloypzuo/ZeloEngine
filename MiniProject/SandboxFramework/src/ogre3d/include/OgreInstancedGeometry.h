	/** Pre-transforms and batches up meshes for efficient use as instanced geometry
		in a scene
	@remarks
		Shader instancing allows to save both memory and draw calls. While 
		StaticGeometry stores 500 times the same object in a batch to display 500 
		objects, this shader instancing implementation stores only 80 times the object, 
		and then re-uses the vertex data with different shader parameter.
		Although you save memory, you make more draw call. However, you still 
		make less draw calls than if you were rendering each object independently.
		Plus, you can move the batched objects independently of one another which 
		you cannot do with StaticGeometry.
	@par
		Therefore it is important when you are rendering a lot of geometry to 
		batch things up into as few rendering calls as possible. This
		class allows you to build a batched object from a series of entities 
		in order to benefit from this behaviour.
		Batching has implications of it's own though:
		@li Batched geometry cannot be subdivided; that means that the whole
			group will be displayed, or none of it will. This obivously has
			culling issues.
		@li A single material must apply for each batch. In fact this class 
			allows you to use multiple materials, but you should be aware that 
			internally this means that there is one batch per material. 
			Therefore you won't gain as much benefit from the batching if you 
			use many different materials; try to keep the number down.
	@par
		The bounding box information is computed with object position only. 
		It doesn't take account of the object orientation. 
	@par
		The LOD settings of both the Mesh and the Materials used in 
		constructing this instanced geometry will be respected. This means that 
		if you use meshes/materials which have LOD, batches in the distance 
		will have a lower polygon count or material detail to those in the 
		foreground. Since each mesh might have different LOD distances, during 
		build the furthest distance at each LOD level from all meshes  
		in that BatchInstance is used. This means all the LOD levels change at the 
		same time, but at the furthest distance of any of them (so quality is 
		not degraded). Be aware that using Mesh LOD in this class will 
		further increase the memory required. Only generated LOD
		is supported for meshes.
	@par
		There are 2 ways you can add geometry to this class; you can add
		Entity objects directly with predetermined positions, scales and 
		orientations, or you can add an entire SceneNode and it's subtree, 
		including all the objects attached to it. Once you've added everything
		you need to, you have to call build() the fix the geometry in place. 
	@par
		You should not construct instances of this class directly; instead, call 
		SceneManager::createInstancedGeometry, which gives the SceneManager the 
		option of providing you with a specialised version of this class if it
		wishes, and also handles the memory management for you like other 
		classes.
    @note
		Warning: this class only works with indexed triangle lists at the moment,		do not pass it triangle strips, fans or lines / points, or unindexed geometry.

			Since we're going to be duplicating geometry lots of times, it's

			SubMesh uses shared geometry, or we're looking at a lower LOD, not
			all the vertices are being referenced by faces on that submesh.
			Therefore to duplicate them, potentially hundreds or even thousands
			of times, would be extremely wasteful. Therefore, if a SubMesh at
			a given LOD has wastage, we create an optimised version of it's
