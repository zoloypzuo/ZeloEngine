            Objects are grouped by material to minimise rendering state changes. The map from
            material to renderable object is wrapped in a class for ease of use.
        @par
            This class now includes the concept of 'queue groups' which allows the application
            adding the renderable to specifically schedule it so that it is included in 
            a discrete group. Good for separating renderables into the main scene,
            backgrounds and overlays, and also could be used in the future for more
            complex multipass routines like stenciling.

            Don't use this unless you really need to, manually ordering renderables prevents OGRE
            from sorting them for best efficiency. However this could be useful for ordering 2D
