When a macro hides a function, which must come first in the header file: the
macro definition or the function prototype?

When a macro definition hides a function, the preprocessor must have some
prior knowledge that there is a function with a matching name, therefore its
prototype must appear before the macro definition whether in the same file
or another file that is included before the macro definition.

This also prevents another issue which may occur if a macro were defined
before a function with the same name. Would the preprocessor treat the
function identifier as a macro being used? and thus replace the function
identifier with the replacement list of the macro.
