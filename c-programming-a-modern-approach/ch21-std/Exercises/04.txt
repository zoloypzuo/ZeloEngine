Make a list of all reserved identifiers in the "future library directions"
section of the C99 standard. Distinguish between identifiers that are reserved
for use only when a specific header is included versus identifiers that are
reserved for use as external names.


Reserved identifiers:
All of these reservations are made regardless of what headers are included
within a program.
